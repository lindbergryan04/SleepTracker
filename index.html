                    To understand sleep, we need data. Modern wearable devices, like those used to collect our <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/" target="_blank">dataset</a>, can track the key indicators necessary to measure sleep quality. Let's explore the data from 22 individuals to uncover the secrets of a good night's rest.

                <h2>A Good Night's Sleep</h2>
                <p>
                    What defines a good night's sleep? It's deep, restorative rest shaped by
                    our daily exercise, hormone balance, and stress levels. We measure sleep quality using indicators
                    like <strong>Total Sleep Time (TST)</strong>, <strong>Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)</strong>,
                    <strong>Sleep Fragmentation</strong>, and the <strong>Number of Awakenings</strong>. A key, simple
                    metric that captures overall sleep quality is <strong>Sleep Efficiency</strong>: the percentage of
                    time you're actually asleep in bed. <em>Let's start by examining how sleep efficiency varies among
                        the 22 individuals in our dataset. This will provide a foundation for exploring the deeper
                        factors that influence sleep quality.</em>
                </p>
                <div id="efficiency-chart">
                </div>
                <div id="chart-summary" class="chart-summary-text">
                    <p>For instance, <strong>User 12</strong> stands out with an impressive sleep efficiency of
                        <strong>94.23%</strong>, achieving 343 minutes of total sleep time with only 21 minutes of Wake
                        After Sleep Onset (WASO). In contrast, <strong>User 2</strong> shows a lower efficiency of
                        <strong>73.49%</strong>, with 244 minutes of total sleep time and a higher WASO of 84 minutes.
                        These examples highlight the significant individual differences in baseline sleep quality
                        present in our dataset. <em>Understanding this variability is the first step before we explore
                            specific influences like hormones and stress.</em>

                    Now that we've seen that sleep quality can vary significantly between individuals, the next question is: why? One of the biggest internal factors is our hormonal rhythm. Our body's primary "sleep" and "wake" hormones, <strong>melatonin</strong> and <strong>cortisol</strong>, are crucial for regulating our sleep cycle. When their natural rhythms are disrupted, our sleep can suffer (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54806-7" target="_blank"

                <h2>Hormones: The Conductors of Your Sleep Orchestra</h2>
                <p><strong>Melatonin</strong>, the 'hormone of darkness', signals to your body that it's time to sleep. <strong>Cortisol</strong>, the 'stress hormone', follows an opposite rhythm, peaking in the morning to promote wakefulness. A healthy sleep-wake cycle depends on these two hormones working in harmony. Imbalances can lead to trouble falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and unrefreshing rest.</p>
                <p>In the visualization below, we examine how melatonin and cortisol levels relate to different sleep
                    metrics. Each user has a blue bar for melatonin (top chart) and an orange bar for cortisol (bottom
                    chart). We've sorted the users horizontally so that 'better' sleep outcomes for the chosen metric
                    are generally on the right side, and 'poorer' outcomes are on the left. For the melatonin chart, an
                    upward-sloping trendline (when enabled) suggests a positive correlation: higher melatonin levels may
                    be linked to these better sleep outcomes. Hover over any bar to see the specific hormone value and

                    But we are not just a collection of hormones. Our mental state plays a pivotal role in sleep. Everyday stress can disrupt cortisol rhythms, while our emotions can influence melatonin production. This creates a complex feedback loop between mind and body that directly impacts sleep quality (<a

                <h2>Stress and Emotion: The Mind-Sleep Connection</h2>
                <p>Our mental and emotional states are deeply intertwined with our sleep. High levels of stress can lead to a state of hyperarousal, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. In the visualization, we explore the connection between self-reported stress, emotions, and objective sleep quality metrics. But it's not all bad newsâ€”could positive emotions actually improve our sleep? Let's investigate.</p>

                        <h4>The Vicious Cycle of Stress, Negative Emotions, and Poor Sleep</h4>
                        <p>
                            It's a well-known cycle: stress hurts sleep, and poor sleep makes us more vulnerable to stress. Our data suggests a similar pattern. Higher daily stress scores tend to correlate with more fragmented and lower-quality sleep.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The link with negative emotions is more complex. While our dataset shows a weak connection, likely due to its small size, broader research confirms that poor sleep can amplify negative feelings, which in turn can make it harder to sleep. Stress, negative emotions, and poor sleep are often entangled in a feedback loop. Our goal here is to visualize and untangle these relationships.

                    Finally, let's turn to a factor where we have significant control: our physical activity. How we move our bodies during the day can profoundly impact how we rest at night. While moderate exercise is generally beneficial, research shows that timing and intensity are key to unlocking its sleep-promoting benefits (<a

            <h1>Project Writeup</h1>
            I have created a classification model that allows a user to input how many minutes of each activity they
            engaged in throughout the day, and returns their predicted sleep score given their most similar user. The
            code on the back end that does the classification is complete but I am still in the process of creating the
            sliders to allow the user to input their minutes per activity.
            I made a small multiples visualization that allows the user to select a detailed view version of the
            heatmap. It has 2 different hover Interactions that show the activity levels users in our dataset through
            step counts in hours or minutes, with a summary statistic corresponding to each view. I think the most
            challenging part will be to make sure that there is actually flow and story within our project, since we are
            working on visuals that are intuitive to use but may not be to the viewer.
            The most challenging part of our project to design is going to be the interactive portion, where we involve
            the user by predicting their sleep. We are going to have the user adjust their estimated levels of stress,
            activity, and hormones so this is definitely going to be challenging to execute.
