            <p class="lead">Sleep is essential for emotional regulation, recovery, and cognitive health. But what
                actually determines a good night's rest?</p>

            <h1>Project Writeup</h1>
            I have created a classification model that allows a user to input how many minutes of each activity they
            engaged in throughout the day, and returns their predicted sleep score given their most similar user. The
            code on the back end that does the classification is complete but I am still in the process of creating the
            sliders to allow the user to input their minutes per activity.
            I made a small multiples visualization that allows the user to select a detailed view version of the
            heatmap. It has 2 different hover Interactions that show the activity levels users in our dataset through
            step counts in hours or minutes, with a summary statistic corresponding to each view. I think the most
            challenging part will be to make sure that there is actually flow and story within our project, since we are
            working on visuals that are intuitive to use but may not be to the viewer.
            The most challenging part of our project to design is going to be the interactive portion, where we involve
            the user by predicting their sleep. We are going to have the user adjust their estimated levels of stress,
            activity, and hormones so this is definitely going to be challenging to execute.

                <h2>What Influences a Good Night's Sleep?</h2>
                <p>Sleep is a cornerstone of our well-being, deeply intertwined with our physical and mental health. But
                    what truly defines a 'good night's sleep'? It's more than just the hours clocked in bed. It involves
                    a complex interplay of factors, from our daily stress and physical activity to the subtle dance of
                    hormones like melatonin (which promotes sleep) and cortisol (which keeps us alert). To gauge sleep
                    quality, we look at several key indicators: <strong>Total Sleep Time (TST)</strong> ‚Äì the actual
                    amount of time spent asleep; <strong>Sleep Latency</strong> ‚Äì how long it takes to fall asleep;
                    <strong>Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)</strong> ‚Äì the amount of time spent awake after initially
                    falling asleep and before finally waking up; and measures of sleep disruption like <strong>Sleep
                        Fragmentation</strong> or the <strong>Number of Awakenings</strong>.<br><br>One of the most
                    comprehensive metrics is <strong>Sleep Efficiency</strong> ‚Äì the percentage of time spent actually
                    asleep while in bed. Let's explore how sleep efficiency varies across different individuals,
                    offering a glimpse into the diverse landscape of human sleep.</p>

                <div id="chart-summary" class="chart-summary-text">
                    <p>For instance, <strong>User 12</strong> stands out with an impressive sleep efficiency of
                        <strong>94.23%</strong>, achieving 343 minutes of total sleep time with only 21 minutes of Wake
                        After Sleep Onset (WASO). In contrast, <strong>User 2</strong> shows a lower efficiency of
                        <strong>73.49%</strong>, with 244 minutes of total sleep time and a higher WASO of 84 minutes.
                        These examples highlight the significant individual differences in sleep patterns and quality.</p>

                <p>More movement, better sleep. The actigraph recorded physical activity throughout the day to help us understand how users' activity levels might influence their nightly rest. Physical activity is one of the most consistent predictors of better sleep efficiency and duration across individuals.</p>
                <p>
                    A 2023 systematic review titled <em><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373188904_The_Effect_of_Physical_Activity_on_Sleep_Quality_and_Sleep_Disorder_A_Systematic_Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Physical Activity on Sleep Quality and Sleep Disorder</a></em> supports this connection. The review found that regular moderate-intensity physical activity‚Äîsuch as walking, yoga, or cycling‚Äîsignificantly improves sleep quality across diverse populations. The study also emphasizes that while moderate activity during the day can promote restful sleep, vigorous exercise performed too close to bedtime may actually interfere with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These findings underscore the importance of monitoring daily activity as part of sleep tracking. Our visualization allows users to explore how their movement patterns might be influencing their sleep outcomes and supports informed behavioral changes to enhance rest and recovery.
