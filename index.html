            <p class="lead">Sleep is essential for emotional regulation, recovery, and cognitive health. But what
                actually determines a good night's rest?</p>

            <h1>Project Writeup</h1>
            I have created a classification model that allows a user to input how many minutes of each activity they
            engaged in throughout the day, and returns their predicted sleep score given their most similar user. The
            code on the back end that does the classification is complete but I am still in the process of creating the
            sliders to allow the user to input their minutes per activity.
            I made a small multiples visualization that allows the user to select a detailed view version of the
            heatmap. It has 2 different hover Interactions that show the activity levels users in our dataset through
            step counts in hours or minutes, with a summary statistic corresponding to each view. I think the most
            challenging part will be to make sure that there is actually flow and story within our project, since we are
            working on visuals that are intuitive to use but may not be to the viewer.
            The most challenging part of our project to design is going to be the interactive portion, where we involve
            the user by predicting their sleep. We are going to have the user adjust their estimated levels of stress,
            activity, and hormones so this is definitely going to be challenging to execute.

                <h2>What Influences a Good Night's Sleep?</h2>
                <p>Sleep is a cornerstone of our well-being, deeply intertwined with our physical and mental health. But
                    what truly defines a 'good night's sleep'? It's more than just the hours clocked in bed. It involves
                    a complex interplay of factors, from our daily stress and physical activity to the subtle dance of
                    hormones like melatonin (which promotes sleep) and cortisol (which keeps us alert). To gauge sleep
                    quality, we look at several key indicators: <strong>Total Sleep Time (TST)</strong> ‚Äì the actual
                    amount of time spent asleep; <strong>Sleep Latency</strong> ‚Äì how long it takes to fall asleep;
                    <strong>Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)</strong> ‚Äì the amount of time spent awake after initially
                    falling asleep and before finally waking up; and measures of sleep disruption like <strong>Sleep
                        Fragmentation</strong> or the <strong>Number of Awakenings</strong>.<br><br>One of the most
                    comprehensive metrics is <strong>Sleep Efficiency</strong> ‚Äì the percentage of time spent actually
                    asleep while in bed. Let's explore how sleep efficiency varies across different individuals,
                    offering a glimpse into the diverse landscape of human sleep.

                    <p>For instance, <strong>User 12</strong> stands out with an impressive sleep efficiency of
                        <strong>94.23%</strong>, achieving 343 minutes of total sleep time with only 21 minutes of Wake
                        After Sleep Onset (WASO). In contrast, <strong>User 2</strong> shows a lower efficiency of
                        <strong>73.49%</strong>, with 244 minutes of total sleep time and a higher WASO of 84 minutes.
                        These examples highlight the significant individual differences in sleep patterns and quality.

            <div class="module" id="hormones">
                <h2>üåô Hormones</h2>
                <p>Melatonin, often called the "sleep hormone," is produced in the evening to help you wind down and
                    prepare for sleep. Its levels typically rise as it gets dark and peak overnight. Cortisol, on the
                    other hand, is a key stress hormone that also plays a role in your sleep-wake cycle. Cortisol levels
                    naturally peak in the morning to help you wake up and feel alert, then gradually decline throughout
                    the day. Disruptions in these hormone rhythms can significantly impact sleep quality.
                    <br><br><i>Note: User 12 in the chart below is a notable outlier, displaying exceptionally high
                        cortisol levels. Significant stress or alcohol consumption before bed acutely raises cortisol,
                        thereby disrupting sleep patterns.</i>

                        <h4>What is the relationship between Negative Emotions and Stress to Sleep Quality?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We see that higher daily stress scores generally mean more fragmented sleep. We see this positive trend in the relationship to stress and all our sleep metrics.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relationship of sleep with negative emotions is more difficult to explain. It's rather clear the more sless leads to worst sleep. But instead with negative emotions we see that have lower quality sleep is associated with more negative emotions. Though in our own data this relationship seems weak due to our relativley small sample, this relationship is supported. But all three are correlated with each other, high stress can lead to more negative emotions, leading to worst sleep, and worst sleep and lead to more ngeative emotions and threfore lead to high stress. Our goal is to highlight this relationship.

                            <strong>Consider:</strong> Individual responses to stress can vary widely due to lifestyle, genetics,
                            and coping mechanisms. This chart provides a snapshot, not a definitive diagnosis.

                            and Sleep Disorder</a></em> supports this connection. The review found that regular

                    quality across diverse populations. The study also emphasizes that while moderate activity during
                    the day can promote restful sleep, vigorous exercise performed too close to bedtime may actually
                    interfere with it.
