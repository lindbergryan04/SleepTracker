                actually determines a good night's rest?</p>

            <h1>Project Writeup</h1>
            I have created a classification model that allows a user to input how many minutes of each activity they engaged in throughout the day, and returns their predicted sleep score given their most similar user. The code on the back end that does the classification is complete but I am still in the process of creating the sliders to allow the user to input their minutes per activity. 
            I made a small multiples visualization that allows the user to select a detailed view version of the heatmap. It has 2 different hover Interactions that show the activity levels users in our dataset through step counts in hours or minutes, with a summary statistic corresponding to each view. I think the most challenging part will be to make sure that there is actually flow and story within our project, since we are working on visuals that are intuitive to use but may not be to the viewer. 
            The most challenging part of our project to design is going to be the interactive portion, where we involve the user by predicting their sleep. We are going to have the user adjust their estimated levels of stress, activity, and hormones so this is definitely going to be challenging to execute.

                <h2>What does it mean to sleep well?</h2>
                <p>Sleep is a complex process that involves the brain, hormones, and the body. It's not just about the
                    amount of time you spend in bed, but also about the quality of your sleep. Sleep quality can be
                    measured by many factors, including total sleep time, sleep fragmentation, wake after sleep onset,
                    and more.
